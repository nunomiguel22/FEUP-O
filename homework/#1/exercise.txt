The corporation Weigelt has three factories with excess of production capacity. Fortunately, the company 
has a new product ready to be produced, and all three factories can produce it. Thus, some of the excess 
of capacity can be used for the new product. 
This product can be produced in three different sizes (large, medium, and small), with a unitary profit of 
420€, 360€ and 300€, respectively. Factories 1, 2 and 3 have excess of capacity, which enables them to 
produce 750, 900 and 450 units of this product per day, respectively, independently of the produced 
size or the combination of different sizes. 
The availability of storage space during the production process also imposes a limitation in the 
production of the new product. Factories 1, 2 and 3 have storage capacity of 13 000, 12 000 and 5 000 
square meters, respectively, for a production day. Each unit of large, medium, and small product 
produced per day requires 20, 15 and 12 square meters, respectively.
The sales forecast indicates that 900, 1200 and 750 units of large, medium, and small sizes can be sold 
daily, respectively.

(i) The management wants to know how many units of each size to produce in each factory to maximize 
the profit. Formulate the linear programming model for this problem.

(ii) In each factory, some of the employees may be fired, unless most of the excess production could be 
used to produce the new product. To avoid firing employees, management decided that the three 
factories should use the same percentage of the excess capacity to produce the new product. How to 
incorporate this new constraint in the formulation?
