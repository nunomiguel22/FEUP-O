A conference organizer must cater for lunches for the 5 days of a conference. The organizer is faced with the
problem of deciding on the daily supply of clean serviettes. The organizer knows that the number of conference
attendees requiring lunch for the 5 days are 130, 220, 180, 120, and 100. The alternatives are:
• to buy new serviettes at 25¢ each piece, or
• to send used serviettes to the laundry where they can receive either a 48 h service at 10¢ a serviette, or
a 24 h service at 15¢ a serviette.
If this conference is a once-off activity with respect to the provision of serviettes, how should the organiser
provide serviettes to minimize the total cost?
